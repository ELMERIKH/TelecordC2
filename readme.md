Telecord is an advanced crossplatform c2 using discord and telegram api ,it allows multi agent handling with ease

using Telegram and discord APIs can be good for exfiltration and network evasion , this project is built to enhance red teaming operations 

Telecord works by combining the two APIs to get seamless and easy interaction with each agent 

agents support mac,linux and windows

quick overview of how it works :
-------
![alt text](<images/2024-04-04 17_01_58-Telecord - Tableau blanc en ligne.png>)

the agent consist of 2 subagents , the fist is a discord bot and the other is a telegram bot.

since telegram does not allow multipleagents to run at the same time. by default the telegram bot is asleep inside our discord bot until we want to interact with it by sending the !interact command to the discord bot ,once it receives it wakes up the telegram bot ,meaning our session enabling us to execute more commands 

list of commands below:
